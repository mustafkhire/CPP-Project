Milestone 3
Reflection
Nov 27/ 2020

Dear Cornel,

I would like to say that I found your lectures to be very informative, and I feel that you were patient with us during our lectures by going over the material when
we asked you to reiterate what you were talking about. I wish you nothing by the best, and enjoy your holidays.

Sincerly,
Mustaf Khire
